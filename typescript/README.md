## ✨ What is This?

This is an **MCP server implementation in TypeScript** for [MonkDB](https://monkdb.com), enabling:
- LLM frameworks like **Claude**, **LangChain**, **CrewAI**, and others to interact with MonkDB.
- Secure, controlled SQL access to MonkDB clusters.
- Extensible plug-and-play architecture to add new tools and utilities.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Supports `SELECT` queries with parameterized inputs
- 📋 Lists and describes MonkDB tables
- 🩺 Provides health and version check utilities
- 🔐 Uses environment-based credentials for safety
- 📦 Exports a clean API with `startMonkDBMCPServer()` entry point
- 🧪 Production-ready with Jest-style unit tests

---

## 📦 Installation

```bash
npm install @monkdb/monkdb-mcp
```

## 🛠️ Usage

As a CLI (via stdio transport)

```ts
// server.mts
import { startMonkDBMCPServer } from '@monkdb/monkdb-mcp';

await startMonkDBMCPServer();
```

Run the server with:

```bash
node build/server.mjs
```

Or use in your MCP host like Claude Desktop, LangChain, etc.

## 🔧 Configuration

Create a `.env` file or use environment variables:

```text
MONKDB_HOST=127.0.0.1
MONKDB_API_PORT=4200
MONKDB_USER=your_user
MONKDB_PASSWORD=your_password
MONKDB_SCHEMA=monkdb  # Optional (defaults to monkdb)
```

## 🧰 Supported Tools

| Tool Name            | Description                                         |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `list_tables`          | Lists tables under `MONKDB_SCHEMA`                    |
| `run_select_query`     | Executes `SELECT` queries (**others are blocked**)        |
| `health_check`         | Runs `SELECT 1` to verify DB connectivity             |
| `get_server_version`   | Returns server version using `SELECT version()`        |
